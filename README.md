# Anki Autolookup

**This is an unfinished project and should not be used yet.**

## For Teammates (**Will be removed**)
Here are some resources you may want to read. The first one is a documentation
of an extension of Anki Desktop. You will need to install it first (via `sudo
apt-get install anki`) then follow the instructions in the documentaion. The
second and third ones are tutorials to Github. If you need anything else just
google it. Please read them and try to use it on your laptop by adding some 
files, commit and push them. The last one is a guide on how to write python
codes that are easier for others to read. I think we can try to follow it as
much as we can.

### Goals
I list some goals we can try to achieve. Feel free to add anything more you want 
to try.

- A crawler to look up definitions, examples and pronunciation of words.
- Automatically add cards with the information above to Anki
- Read text and search difficult words and add them into Anki.
- Picture-to-text recognition
